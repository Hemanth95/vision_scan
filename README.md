# vision_scan

Description:
vision_scan is a repository dedicated to barcode scanning using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The project harnesses the power of computer vision to identify and decode barcodes within images or video streams.

Project Overview:
The primary goal of this project is to leverage YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient barcode detection. By integrating the YOLOv8 model into the scanning system, the project facilitates real-time barcode recognition, making it suitable for various applications such as inventory management, retail, and logistics.

Features:

    Barcode scanning using YOLOv8.
    Integration of YOLOv8 model for object detection.
    Support for processing images and video streams.

Project Structure:

    /src: Contains scripts and modules specific to barcode scanning using YOLOv8.
